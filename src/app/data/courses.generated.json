    "description": "To harvest the enormous potential of ground-breaking research in the field of biotechnology, large amounts of financing are needed. From the first lab results to a commercially viable product, many years go by, and much money is burned. Thus, financing is the key to making biotechnology innovations accessible to everyone.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will have the confidence to talk to and convince investors to fund your endeavor. To do so, the course offers an introduction to financing and discusses the different motivations of those involved in financing. It will also enable you to evaluate different sources of financing. Moreover, it will establish an understanding of the challenges faced during the fundraising process, such as valuing a company, the legal aspects of an investment contract, or pitching your company to investors. Thereby, it will provide you with the confidence of managing the fundraising process and communicating your project effectively to any type of financial backer.",

    "description": "Ship data and schema changes without outages. This hands-on course teaches you how to treat schemas as contracts, evolve them safely, and keep producers, consumers, and warehouses green end-to-end. You’ll design compatibility policies in a Schema Registry (backward/forward/full, transitive), automate checks in CI, and practice expand → adapt → contract rollouts. In streaming labs, you’ll capture OLTP changes with Debezium, deliver Avro-encoded events to Kafka, and route malformed records to a DLQ with actionable alerts. On the analytics side, you’ll evolve BigQuery/Iceberg schemas additively (NULLABLE/defaulted columns), shield downstream users with views/contracts, and validate correctness with queries and time travel. Realistic scenarios walk you through enum expansions, type widening, null/tombstone semantics, and subject naming rules. \n\nThis course is for data engineers, backend engineers, and analytics engineers who work with real-time or streaming data systems and need to evolve schemas without downtime. It’s also useful for platform engineers and architects responsible for data contracts, CDC pipelines, or Kafka-based platforms.\n\nLearners should have basic SQL knowledge and a general understanding of streaming systems such as Kafka, along with familiarity with Git and the command line. Experience with schemas, CDC, Docker, or cloud data warehouses is helpful but not required.\n\nBy the end, you’ll have runnable templates, governance checklists, and a portfolio-ready project that proves you can design zero-downtime change—confidently and repeatably.

    "description": "Investing time in your management skills will pay dividends for you and your team (and your boss!), yet most people never study management in any scientific way. Excellent management is actually easy to learn, but trying to pick it up by copying good or bad leaders is surprisingly difficult. Improvising as you go rarely leads to consistently effective results.\n\nAs a leader, there’s a lot on your plate. You’re expected to lead a team, make tough decisions, delegate work (without micromanaging!), and somehow keep everyone happy and productive. On top of that, you need to delegate properly, avoid burnout, and make your boss think you’ve got everything under control. The good news? This course is here to help.\n\nYou’ll learn the difference between management and leadership, how to delegate effectively, what your leadership options are, how to motivate different types of people, and when to empower others without slipping into abdication.\n\nI designed this course specifically for people just like you—those thrown into the deep end of leadership who want practical advice that works right now. Whether you’re managing a small team or leading in a large organization, I’ll give you the tools and strategies you need to succeed.\n\nYou’ll love this course because it isn’t a boring list of “dos and don’ts.” It’s packed with real-world, practical advice that’s been tested by thousands of managers I’ve worked with.

Basically, it is a repetitive and boring manual task that repeats every month and takes a lot of your time. However, you can easily automate it with SharePoint and Power Automate!\n\nIn this beginner-level guided project \"Automize Monthly Report Creation with Power Automate\", we will create a SharePoint Site and a SharePoint list with data about employees' annual leave days, sick leave days or days off. All the data will be kept in one place. That data will help us to create the Monthly Employee Absence Report. The Power Automate flow will export data from the SharePoint list and save it in an Excel spreadsheet. Then we will send the table (the report) in an email as an Excel table.\n\nThe requirement for this project is having a Microsoft Developer Program account, and you will be provided with instructions on how to get it right here.\n\nIf you are ready to make your and your colleagues’ lives easier by starting to automate manual, time-consuming processes which are hard to track, then this project is for you!
